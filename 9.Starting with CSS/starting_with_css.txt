1. What is CSS and why use it?
   CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to style HTML documents. It allows for separation of content and design, making web pages more visually appealing and easier to maintain.

2. What are the different ways to bring CSS into an HTML file?
   CSS can be included in an HTML file in three ways:
   - Inline CSS: Using the style attribute within HTML elements.
   - Internal CSS: Placing CSS within a <style> tag in the HTML <head>.
   - External CSS: Linking to an external stylesheet using the <link> tag in the HTML <head>.

3. What do you mean by specificity in CSS?
   Specificity determines which CSS rules apply when multiple rules target the same element. It is calculated based on the types of selectors used, prioritizing inline styles, IDs, classes, and element selectors in that order.
