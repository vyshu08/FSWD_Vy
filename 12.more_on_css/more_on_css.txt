CSS Assignment
1.Why is it called a pseudo-class ?
Ans. It's pseudo because you didn't make it; the browser 'created' it and allows you to set it to change the look of the link when it's in that state.but why is it a class? If you can only hover or one area of the screen at a time, then only one p can take the CSS rule at any time. Doesn't class imply several elements belonging to some common group, and a class style rule means all of them will inherit that rule?
The pseudo-class can be assumed as a state. And every element that has the state hover can be classified by :hover. So whenever a a element gets the state hover, it can be selected with :hover
