HTML Assignment
1.What are inline and block elements in html and the difference between them? Name a few inline elements and block elements.
Ans .Inline elements are those which only occupy the space bounded by the tags defining the element, instead of breaking the flow of the content. Note: An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.
Examples of inline elements:
<a>
<strong> , <em> , <b> , <i> , <q>, <mark>
<span>
A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block". Browsers typically display the block-level element with a newline both before and after the element
Example of Block Elements:
<address>
<article>
<aside>
<blockquote>
<canvas>
<dd>
<div>
<dl>
Difference Between Inline and Block Elements in HTML
Block elements always start from a new line. Inline elements never start from a new line. Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
