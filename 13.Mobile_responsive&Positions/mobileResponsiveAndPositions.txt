1. What are media queries in CSS and their use case?
   Media queries apply styles based on device characteristics, enabling responsive design for different screen sizes.

2. Difference between min-width and max-width in media queries in CSS:
   - min-width: Applies styles for viewports wider than a specified value.
   - max-width: Applies styles for viewports narrower than a specified value.

3. Explain float property and clear property in CSS with examples:
   - Float Property: Positions elements left or right, allowing text to wrap.
    
     .float-left {
         float: left;
     }
     
    
     <div class="float-left">Floating Left</div>
     <p>Text wraps around the floating div.</p>
     
   - Clear Property: Prevents wrapping around floated elements.
    
     .clear {
         clear: both;
     }
     
    
     <div class="float-left">Floating Left</div>
     <div class="clear">This div is below the floated element.</div>
